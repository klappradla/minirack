# Minirack

My micro version of [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack), a minimal webserver interface in ruby for simple wrapping of http requests and responses. A tiny project to understand the basics of what Rack actually does.
The idea was inspired by [this blog post](http://www.kavinder.com/blog/2014-10-10-rebuild-a-gem-rack/)
